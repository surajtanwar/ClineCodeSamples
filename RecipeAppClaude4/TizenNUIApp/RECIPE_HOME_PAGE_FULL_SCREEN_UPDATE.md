# Recipe Home Page - Full Screen Update

## Overview
The RecipeHomePage has been updated to display recipe cards in full-screen format as shown in the home.png design mockup. This provides a more immersive and detailed view of each recipe.

## Changes Made

### New Full-Screen Layout
- **Full-screen recipe cards**: Each card now takes up the entire screen (720x1080px)
- **Large recipe image**: Top portion of screen (720x400px) for prominent visual impact
- **Heart button overlay**: Positioned in top-right corner of the image
- **Expanded content area**: More space for recipe details below the image

### Enhanced Content Display
- **Larger title text**: Increased font size for better readability
- **Centered layout**: Recipe title and stats are now center-aligned
- **Expanded description**: Much more space (660x400px) for detailed recipe descriptions
- **Larger icons and text**: Stats (time, likes, comments) use bigger icons (24x24px) and text

### Horizontal Scrolling
- **Swipe navigation**: Users can swipe horizontally between full-screen recipe cards
- **Container width**: Set to 2160px (720px × 3 cards) to enable smooth horizontal scrolling
- **No padding**: Cards are edge-to-edge for seamless full-screen experience

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added
- **CreateFullScreenRecipeCard()**: Creates full-screen recipe cards matching the design
- **CreateLargeStatItem()**: Creates larger stat items with bigger icons and text

### Updated Methods
