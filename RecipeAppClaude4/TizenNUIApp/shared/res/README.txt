App Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain:
- TizenNUIApp.png (117x117 pixels recommended)

This icon file is referenced in the tizen-manifest.xml and will be displayed on the Tizen device home screen.

To complete the setup:
1. Replace this placeholder with an actual PNG icon file named "TizenNUIApp.png"
2. Ensure the icon follows Tizen design guidelines
3. Test the icon display on the target device
