- Container height larger than viewport to enable scrolling
- Proper touch event handling

- Handles page switching by removing/adding views to window
- Event-driven architecture for clean separation of concerns

### Menu Button Integration
- Menu button in RecipeHomePage header is now functional
- Touch event properly wired to navigation system
- Consistent with app's interaction patterns

## Future Enhancements

3. **Settings Page**: Create dedicated settings page
4. **Deep Navigation**: Implement sub-menus for complex sections
5. **Icons**: Add icons to menu items for better visual hierarchy
6. **Animations**: Add smooth transitions between pages

### Code Structure

- Event-driven architecture supports complex navigation flows
- Consistent styling system for maintainability

## Build Status
✅ Successfully compiles for both Tizen 7.0 and Tizen 10.0
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Proper event handling implemented
✅ Navigation system functional

## Usage
1. Launch the app (shows splash screen)
2. Recipe Home Page appears
3. Click the menu button (hamburger icon) in the header
4. Menu Page opens with all available options
5. Click back button or any menu item to navigate
