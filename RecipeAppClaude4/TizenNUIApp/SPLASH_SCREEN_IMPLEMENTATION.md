# Splash Screen Implementation

## Overview
A splash screen has been successfully implemented for the Tizen NUI application that displays for 2 seconds on application launch. The splash screen is designed to fit the 720x1280 resolution and replicates the provided HTML/CSS design.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. SplashScreen.cs (New)
- Custom splash screen class that extends Tizen.NUI.BaseComponents.View
- Implements the visual design based on the provided HTML/CSS
- Uses a 2-second timer to automatically transition to the main application
- Properly scales the design from original 375x667 to 720x1280 resolution
- Uses Tizen.Applications API for proper resource path resolution
- Includes proper resource disposal for memory management

### 2. Program.cs (Modified)
- Updated to show splash screen first on application launch
- Implements event-driven transition from splash to main content
- Maintains the original main application functionality

### 3. TizenNUIApp.csproj (Modified)
- Added all splash screen image resources to the project
- Ensures images are included in the build output

## Design Implementation

### Resolution and Layout
- Target resolution: 720x1280 pixels
- Design matches the uploaded splash screen image with coral/pink gradient background
- Centered layout with proper element positioning

### Visual Elements
1. **Background**: Rectangle.png - Coral/pink gradient background filling entire 720x1280 screen
2. **Chef Hat Icon**: Group.png - White chef hat icon centered horizontally, positioned in upper portion (360, 320)
3. **Text Logo**: Group_2.png - "Chef Recipes" text in white script font, centered below chef hat (360, 580)

### Image Resources Used
- `res/images/splash/Rectangle.png` - Background with gradient effect
- `res/images/splash/Group.png` - Chef hat icon
- `res/images/splash/Group_2.png` - "Chef Recipes" text logo

## Functionality
1. **Application Launch**: Splash screen appears immediately
2. **Timer**: 2-second countdown starts automatically
3. **Transition**: After 2 seconds, splash screen is removed and main content appears
4. **Memory Management**: Splash screen resources are properly disposed

## Technical Features
- Event-driven architecture for clean transitions
- Proper resource management and disposal
- Scalable design that maintains aspect ratios
- Compatible with both Tizen 7.0 and Tizen 10.0 frameworks

## Usage
The splash screen is automatically displayed when the application launches. No additional configuration is required. The application will show:
1. Splash screen (2 seconds)
2. Automatic transition to main application content

## Build Status
✅ Successfully compiles for both Tizen 7.0 and Tizen 10.0
✅ All image resources properly included
✅ No compilation errors or warnings
