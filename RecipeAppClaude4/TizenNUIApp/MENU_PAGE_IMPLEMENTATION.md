### Modified Files
- **Program.cs** - Added navigation logic between RecipeHomePage and MenuPage
- **RecipeHomePage.cs** - Added MenuButtonClicked event and touch handler for menu button

## MenuPage Features

### Design Elements (Matching menu.png)
- **Coral Background**: Full-screen coral/salmon colored background (#F26666)
- **Header Section**: Hamburger menu icon positioned in top-right corner
- **Menu Items**: Clean white text, left-aligned with proper spacing

- **Positioned**: At the bottom of the screen

### Navigation Features
- **Back Button**: Returns to Recipe Home Page
- **Menu Item Selection**: Event-driven navigation system
- **Touch Feedback**: Visual feedback on menu item interaction
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new menu items and sections

## Technical Implementation

### Event System
```csharp
public event EventHandler<MenuItemSelectedEventArgs> MenuItemSelected;
```

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks menu button on Recipe Home Page
2. MenuButtonClicked event is fired
3. Program.cs handles the event and shows MenuPage
4. User can navigate back or select menu items
5. MenuItemSelected event provides navigation target

### Styling
- **Background**: Coral/salmon color (#F26666) - full screen
- **Text Color**: White text throughout
- **Active Indicator**: White vertical line (4px width, 40px height)
- **Typography**: Samsung One font family with appropriate sizing
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins throughout
- **Profile Image**: Circular with 40px corner radius

### Layout Configuration
- Linear vertical layout for main structure
- No scrolling needed - all content fits on screen
- Fixed positioning for profile section at bottom
- Proper touch event handling for all interactive elements

## Integration with Main App

### Program.cs Navigation Logic
- Maintains references to both RecipeHomePage and MenuPage
- Handles page switching by removing/adding views to window
- Event-driven architecture for clean separation of concerns

### Menu Button Integration
- Menu button in RecipeHomePage header is now functional
- Touch event properly wired to navigation system
- Consistent with app's interaction patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Search Functionality**: Add search bar to menu
2. **User Profile**: Implement profile section with user details
3. **Settings Page**: Create dedicated settings page
4. **Deep Navigation**: Implement sub-menus for complex sections
5. **Icons**: Add icons to menu items for better visual hierarchy
6. **Animations**: Add smooth transitions between pages

### Code Structure
- Modular design allows easy extension
- Event-driven architecture supports complex navigation flows
- Consistent styling system for maintainability

## Build Status
✅ Successfully compiles for both Tizen 7.0 and Tizen 10.0
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Proper event handling implemented
✅ Navigation system functional

## Usage
1. Launch the app (shows splash screen)
2. Recipe Home Page appears
3. Click the menu button (hamburger icon) in the header
4. Menu Page opens with all available options
5. Click back button or any menu item to navigate
6. Menu items currently show placeholder behavior (ready for implementation)

The menu page provides a solid foundation for app navigation and can be easily extended with additional functionality as the app grows.
